<sect>Overview<p>

This file contains an overview of the Ben Eater 6502 runtime system as it comes
with the cc65 C compiler. It describes the memory layout, Ben Eater's 6502 specific header
files, available drivers, and any pitfalls specific to that platform.

<!--
Please note that Supervision specific functions are just mentioned here, they are
described in detail in the separate <url url="funcref.html" name="function
reference">. Even functions marked as "platform dependent" may be available on
more than one platform. Please see the function reference for more information.
-->

<sect>Binary format<p>

The standard binary output format generated by the linker for the Supervision target
is a 32kB machine language program. It is of course possible to change this 
behaviour by using one of the different linker configs.

<sect>Memory layout<p>

cc65 generated programs with the default setup have a usable ROM range of &dollar;8000 - &dollar;FFF9.

Special locations:

<descrip>
  <tag/IO/
  The IO device (WSD65C22) is mapped starting at &dollar;6000.

  <tag/RAM/
  The RAM range is &dollar;0200 - &dollar;3FFF. 

  <tag/Stack/
  The C runtime stack is located at &dollar;3FFF and grows downwards.

</descrip><p>


<sect>Platform specific header files<p>

Programs containing Ben Eater's 6502 specific code may use the <tt/be6502.h/ header file.

<sect1>Hardware access<p>

The following pseudo variables declared in the <tt/supervision.inc/ include file do
allow access to hardware located in the address space.

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/_PORTB/</tag>
  <tag><tt/_PORTA/</tag>
  <tag><tt/_DDRB/</tag>
  <tag><tt/_DDRA/</tag>

</descrip><p>


<sect>Loadable drivers<p>

No drivers are currently available for Ben Eater's 6502.
